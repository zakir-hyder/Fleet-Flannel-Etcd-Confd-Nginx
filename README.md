## Tools used:
  - coreos: server machine clustering via a shared cloud-config.yml
  - etcd: key value store for service registration and discovery
  - fleet: scheduling/failover of docker containers across coreos cluster
  - flannel: Gives each docker container a unique ip that allows you to access the internal port (i.e. port 80 not 32679)
  - confd: watch etcd for nodes arriving/leaving - template nginx configuration files / reload nginx on change
